company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS PVT.LTD NAME: Saurabh Chikte Intern Id: :CT08IEO DOMAIN: Mern Stack Web Development BATCH DURATION: :30/12/2024 to 30/01/2025 MENTOR NAME: Neela Santhosh Kumar

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TASK DESCRIPTION -> Project Overview: This project aims to develop a real-time chat application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application will allow users to send and receive messages in real-time, create user profiles, and participate in group chats or private conversations.

Features: User Authentication and Authorization:

Sign up/Login: Users can register and log in to the application using email and password. JWT Token Authentication: Implement JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management and secure authentication. Profile Management: Users can update their profile picture, username, and other personal details. Real-time Messaging:

Message Sending/Receiving: Users can send and receive messages instantly. Socket.IO: Use Socket.IO for real-time communication between clients and the server. Private Messages: Users can send messages to specific individuals. Group Chats: Users can create or join group chats and interact with multiple users in a single room. Message Storage:

MongoDB Database: Messages will be stored in MongoDB for persistence. Message History: Users can view past conversations in both private and group chats. Search and Filter: Implement functionality to search for past messages by keywords or sender. User Interface (Frontend - React):

Responsive UI: A clean and modern chat interface that adapts to different screen sizes. Chat Window: Display messages in a scrollable chat window. Message Input: Users can type and send messages with support for emojis, links, and file attachments. Notification System: Real-time notifications for new messages or when a user joins a chat. Typing Indicators: Show when a user is typing a message. Backend (Node.js/Express):

API Endpoints: Set up RESTful API endpoints for authentication, retrieving chat history, user details, and managing conversations. Socket Management: Handle real-time socket connections for chat functionality. Data Validation: Ensure secure data transmission and validate user input. Security and Best Practices:

Data Encryption: Encrypt passwords and sensitive data. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Configure proper CORS settings to allow communication between the frontend and backend. Rate Limiting and Security: Implement security measures such as rate-limiting API requests, input validation, and securing socket connections. Deployment:

Hosting: Deploy the frontend on a service like Netlify or Vercel, and the backend on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean. Environment Variables: Use .env files for managing sensitive keys like database URIs, JWT secrets, etc. Deliverables: Fully functional real-time chat application. Clean and well-documented codebase. Deployment on a cloud platform. User manual (optional) detailing how to use the application. Timeline: Phase 1: Project setup and planning (1-2 days) Phase 2: Backend development (2-3 days) Phase 3: Frontend development (3-4 days) Phase 4: Integration and testing (2-3 days) Phase 5: Deployment and final adjustments (1-2 days) Tools and Technologies: Frontend: React.js, CSS (or styled-components), Material-UI/Bootstrap (optional) Backend: Node.js, Express.js Real-time Communication: Socket.IO Database: MongoDB Authentication: JWT, bcrypt.js (for hashing passwords) Deployment: Netlify/Vercel (Frontend), Heroku/AWS/DigitalOcean (Backend)

*conclusion -> This project will help you gain hands-on experience with real-time web applications, full-stack development, and working with the MERN stack.
